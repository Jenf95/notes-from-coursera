#I want to delete all the rows in a dataframe that is February 29th from year 2005-2014
#this is my terrible code
for time in df['Date']:
    if time[-5:] == '02-29':
        df.drop(df.iloc(df.index(time)))
        
#this is invalid code, "RangeIndex" object is not callable
#how would you write it?
